Based on an analysis on 1974 tax maps a report found that "in almost 50 per cent of West Virginia counties, at least half the land is owned by the out-of-state corporate interests".

Undoubtedly things have changed since then - but the report is interesting nonetheless.
 
[Absentees Dominate Land Ownership](http://www.as.wvu.edu/wvhistory/documents/104.pdf).

In Marion County the largest landowner was Consolidation Coal Co. with 124,503 acres at the time of the report.

The author takes a clear stance on the subject: 
> Often paying tiny property taxes, they extract the state's rich deposits of coal, timber, oil and gas.
> And their activities inevitably help sustain the striking paradox of a state with abundant mineral wealth and much abject poverty."
